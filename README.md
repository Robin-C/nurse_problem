This repo uses linear programming to find a solution to a scheduling problem. The person run a department with 4 employees and the employees need to take turns for the weekend. They reached out and I was happy to help :)

# Goal 

Goal is to minimize the number of people working weekends.

# Constraints

## 1. Each weekend must be covered by at least 1 employee

For the busiest months, April, May, October, November, December and the first week of January, we need 2 people.

## 2. Employee 4 should have at least 4 weekends off in between each weekend they are scheduled

## 3. Employee 1, 2 and 3 should have an equal (or close to +1/-1) number of weekends they are scheduled for
